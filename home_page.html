  <h1>My Music
    <p>I have always found it difficult to tell what my music taste is to people, 
      so instead of giving a long, and complicated playlist, I made this website. </p>
      <p> The point of this website is to share tracks and albums I love and enjoy. I will give a reason for why I like the specific album or song, and so you can get an idea of my thought process regardig them.</p></h1>
