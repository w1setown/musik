HTML:

The HTML code is structured with a series of div elements, each representing a song. Each song div contains an h2 element for the song title, a div with class spotify-embed for the Spotify player, and a p element for the song description. The spotify-embed divs no longer contain iframe elements; instead, they have a data-src attribute that stores the Spotify URL for the song.
CSS:

The CSS code styles the page. It sets up a flex container for the body, makes the menu sticky, and styles the song sections with a grid layout. Each song section is set to take up at least the full viewport height (min-height: 100vh) and has a background image that covers the entire section (background-size: cover). The .spotify-embed class is positioned fixed at the bottom right of the page.
JavaScript:

The JavaScript code adds a scroll event listener to the window. When the user scrolls, it checks each song section to see if it's currently visible in the viewport. If a song section is visible, it gets the Spotify URL from the data-src attribute of the spotify-embed div in that section, and sets the src attribute of the fixed player (#fixed-player) to this URL. This makes the fixed player at the bottom of the page change its song based on the currently visible song section.
In summary, this code creates a webpage that displays a list of songs. Each song has a title, a description, and a Spotify player. As the user scrolls through the page, the song in the fixed player at the bottom of the page changes to match the currently visible song.
